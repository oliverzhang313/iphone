AApple's A4 processor, first used on the iPad, officially landed on the iPhone 4, but in his WWDC 2010 presentation, Jobs didn't particularly emphasize the high performance of the A4 processor, or even announce the main frequency of the A4 processor used in the iPhone 4, but highlighted the battery power consumption of the iPhone 4.</p>
<p>
Jobs announced the iPhone 4 battery life of 7 hours of 3G calls, 10 hours of video playback, 40 hours of music playback, 300 hours of standby. With the exception of 3G calls, seven hours of talk is two hours longer than the five hours of the iPhone 3GS, and there is no significant improvement in battery life. The iPhone 4 supports UMTS/GSM/GPRS/CDMA networks, as well as dual-frequency HDPA/HSUPA3.5G base with a maximum download speed of 7.8Mbps.In addition, the iPhone 4 supports the 802.11n wireless standard.
